Sometimes our users just keep their sessions open when they go home. At times, such as when we need to install software updates, this is a problem.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to write a CL that cleans up the file/member locks without getting too complicated? You'll be happy to know it is. Unix to the rescue! All you need is to quickly hack together a small nine-line QSH shell script to do the job.
</p>

<p>
See this example file named unlock that lives in my /home/tvl directory on the IFS:
</p>

<p class="terminal">for file in $@; do
  system "WRKOBJLCK OBJ($file) OBJTYPE(*FILE)
  MBR(*ALL)" 2&gt;/dev/null | grep HELD | cut -c 16-46 &gt; /tmp/.jobs.tmp
  while read lock; do
    if [ `echo $lock | wc -c` -gt 1 ]; then
      system "ENDJOB JOB(`echo $lock | cut -d " " -f 3`/`\
        echo $lock | cut -d " " -f 2`/`\
        echo $lock | cut -d " " -f 1`) OPTION(*IMMED) LOGLMT(0)" 2&gt;&amp;1 | \
        grep -v CPC2206 | grep -v CPC1230
    fi
  done &lt; /tmp/.jobs.tmp
  rm /tmp/.jobs.tmp
done</p>

<p>
This script can be called from IBM i with:
</p>

<p class="terminal">QSH CMD('sh /home/tvl/unlock FILE1 FILE2 FILE3 FILEn')</p>

<p>
Or, you can feed it the result of a file list:
</p>

<p class="terminal">QSH CMD('sh /home/tvl/unlock `cat /home/tvl/files`')</p>

<p>
Or, even feed the result of a DB2/400 SQL query. For example:
</p>

<p class="terminal">QSH CMD('sh /home/tvl/unlock `db2 "select name from allfiles where changed=1"`')</p>

<p>
The script will, for every file, first collect jobs that have a file/member lock on the object and output the job details into a temporary file. Next, the script will *IMMED end the job that is holding the lock. The two messages that I am ignoring are:
</p>

<p class="terminal">CPC2206 - Ownership of object QZSHSYSTEM in QTEMP type *USRSPC changed
CPC1230 - LOGLMT changed for job</p>

<p>
Using QSH makes quick system administration jobs easy. No compiling needed, just use the power of a Unix shell.
