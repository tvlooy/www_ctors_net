<p>
At the Hacking At Random (HAR) conference, I did a presentation about IBM's AS/400 system. The talk was intended for people that don't know AS/400. Or, just want to know what's so special about it and want to know how it works.
</p>

<p>
The talk gave a quick historical overview of this extraordinary system, followed by a technical introduction of what defines the IBM i:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>technology independent machine interface
    <li>integrated database
    <li>object based design
    <li>single level store
</ul>

<p>
Next, the basics of working with the system were covered.
</p>

<p>
I linked the slides and paper from the presentation on slideshare.
