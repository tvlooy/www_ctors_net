title: Benchmarking Magento 2 with PHP 7.0.0 RC1
keywords: magento2, php7

<p>
A while ago, I posted some early <a href="https://ctors.net/2015/02/10/symfony2_php7" target="_blank">benchmarks of Symfony2 on PHP7</a>. Today I ran some benchmarks of Magento 2 merchant beta with PHP 7.0.0 RC1. I had to patch Magento 2 myself, mainly because it uses it's own Null, String, Bool classes which are reserved keywords in PHP 7. But, the results are amazing.

<p>
So, the homepage got 133% faster. The category page got 146% faster. The product detail got 169% faster. This is even better than the initial benchmarks I ran.
</p>

<p>
To confirm this speedup, I tested some other frameworks. A Symfony 2.3.16 installation got 117% faster, a Wordpress 4.2.4 installation got 108% faster and a Bolt CMS installation (Silex based) got 152% faster.

<p>
I used a Debian 8 machine for this tests. I'm running PHP-FPM 5.6.12 next to PHP 7.0.0RC1 so it's easy to switch between versions. The script I used to compile PHP 7 is in <a href="https://gist.github.com/tvlooy/881d0d67d0ad699c38a3" target="_blank">this Gist</a>. As always, run your own benchmarks to make conclusions.

Really an amazing job from the PHP developers. Very, very cool. Can't wait to run PHP 7 in production! :-)
