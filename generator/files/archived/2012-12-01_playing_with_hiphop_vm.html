<p>
After Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/speeding-up-php-based-development-with-hiphop-vm/10151170460698920" target="_blank">posted an update</a> on HipHop VM last week I was eager to play with it. So today I did. :-)
</p>

<p>
I installed a fresh Ubuntu Server 12.04 in VirtualBox and installed HipHop like this described in the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php/wiki/Building-and-installing-HHVM-on-Ubuntu-12.04" target="_blank">documentation</a>.
</p>

<p>
Then, I was not sure how to get the thing up and running. Luckily <a href="https://twitter.com/nick_vh" target="_blank">Nick Veenhof</a> wrote a <a href="http://nickveenhof.be/comment/reply/1316" target="_blank">blogpost</a> about testing HHVM with Drupal. I basically took his <span class="terminal">hhvm.hdf</span> and adapted it just a little bit. Thanks Nick! It now looks like this:
</p>

<p class="terminal">Server {
  Port = 80
  SourceRoot = /root/drupal-7.17
}

Eval {
  Jit = true
}
Log {
  Level = Error
  UseLogFile = true
  File = /var/log/hhvm_error.log
  Access {
    * {
      File = /var/log/hhvm_access.log
      Format = %h %l %u %t "%r" %>s %b
    }
  }
}

VirtualHost {
  * {
    Pattern = .*
    RewriteRules {
      dirindex {
        pattern = ^/(.*)/$
        to = $1/index.php
        qsa = true
      }
    }
  }
}

StaticFile {
  FilesMatch {
    * {
      pattern = .*.(dll|exe)
      headers {
        * = Content-Disposition: attachment
      }
    }
  }
  Extensions {
    css = text/css
    gif = image/gif
    html = text/html
    jpe = image/jpeg
    jpeg = image/jpeg
    jpg = image/jpeg
    png = image/png
    tif = image/tiff
    tiff = image/tiff
    txt = text/plain
  }
}</p>

<p>
I started HHVM like this:
</p>

<p class="terminal">dev/hiphop-php/src/hhvm/hhvm --config hhvm.hdf --user root --mode daemon \
    -v "Log.Level=Verbose" -v "Log.NoSilencer=on" -v "Log.Header=on"</p>

<p>
Next, I set up an empty Symfony2 and Drupal7 project and started watching the <span class="terminal">/var/log/hhvm_error.log</span>
</p>

<p>
Unlike Nick, I didn’t have trouble with MySQL / PDO (maybe because I compiled myself and Nick used the package). I looked into the github account and I think they actually do support MySQL and PDO.
</p>

<p>
I was unable to get Symfony2 nor Drupal7 up and running but I made it to their "config" pages after hacking some things out. For example, this was from the hhvm_error.log:
</p>

<p class="terminal">[Sat Dec 1 20:21:05 2012] [hphp] [18496:52aee700:10:000003] [] HipHop Fatal error: f_get_cfg_var is not going to be supported: global configurations not used in /root/Symfony2/app/SymfonyRequirements.php on line 366

Here’s a screenshot of the Symfony2 and Drupal7 config page:<br>

I was just playing around a bit and wanted to share the experience. I'm sure you can get this a bit further. Let me now if you do!
